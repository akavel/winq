# IMPORTANT: because of changes in Go 1.7 runtime, winq will most probably not work correctly as is with it &mdash; it's expected it may result in crashes & memory corruption. I have a planned solution (see [#2](https://github.com/akavel/winq/issues/2)), but to implement it with proper tests & verification will require time I still can't find. If you need this, please contact me via [#2](https://github.com/akavel/winq/issues/2), knowing someone apart from me uses it will help. Also especially examples of crashing code would speed me up a lot.
